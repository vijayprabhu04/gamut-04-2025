# AWS Auto Scaling – Detailed Explanation

# What is AWS Auto Scaling?
- AWS Auto Scaling helps automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances (or other resources) based on traffic demand. 
- It ensures high availability and cost efficiency by scaling up resources when demand increases and scaling down when demand decreases.

# Key Components of AWS Auto Scaling
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG) – A collection of EC2 instances managed together.
- Launch Template – Defines the instance type, AMI, security groups, and other configurations.
- Scaling Policies – Determines when to add or remove instances (e.g., CPU usage exceeds 70%).#
