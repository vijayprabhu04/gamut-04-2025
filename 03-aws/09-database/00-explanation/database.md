# What is AWS RDS?
- AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that allows you to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud with minimal effort.
- Instead of manually installing and maintaining a database, RDS automates tasks like backups, patching, and scaling.
